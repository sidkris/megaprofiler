        "When working with large datasets, itâ€™s often necessary to understand data types, "
        "distributions, and potential issues (e.g., missing values, outliers) before analysis. "
        "While libraries like pandas-profiling exist, there is still room for an extensible, easy-to-use, "
        "and highly customizable profiler that integrates data validation.\n\n"
        "Key Features:\n"
        "- **Automatic Data Summaries**: Provide insights like distribution, unique values, missing values, and more for each column.\n"
        "- **Anomaly Detection**: Automatically flag columns or rows with unusual distributions, outliers, or inconsistent data.\n"
        "- **Data Validation**: Set validation rules (e.g., no missing values in specific columns, data type constraints) and get alerts if the data violates these rules.\n"
        "- **Custom Reports**: Generate visual reports (e.g., HTML, PDF) with configurable thresholds for what counts as an anomaly.\n"
        "- **Data Drift Detection**: Track changes in data distributions over time to identify shifts in data quality or content.\n\n"
        "Benefits:\n"
        "megaprofiler would be invaluable to data scientists and engineers dealing with exploratory data analysis, "
        "data quality checks, and ETL pipelines, reducing manual data investigation and improving data quality oversight."
